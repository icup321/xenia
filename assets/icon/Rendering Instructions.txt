For those not well-versed in Blender, this document explains
how to render the icon in any desired resolution and color.

To Change Resolution:
  1. Open Icon.blend in Blender.
  2. In the right tool pane, look for "Resolution" under the
     "Dimensions" settings. It should be defaulted to 512x512.
     This is where you'll change the icon output dimensions.
  3. After you've set the value to what you want, hit F12 or
     select 'Render' > 'Render Image' from the top bar. This
     will render the icon.
  4. To save, hit F3 or select 'Image' > 'Save As Image' on
     the left toward the middle of the screen.

To Change Colors:
  1. Open Icon.blend in Blender.
  2. The icon's colors will appear in the bottom window as
     labeled nodes. Change them by clicking on each node.
  3. Render and save as described above.
